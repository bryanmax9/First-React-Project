# First-React-Project

# Project Name

Description of your project.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your system. If it's not installed, you can download and install it from the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

## Step by Step Guide
Step 1: Create the React App

In your terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to create your new project. Run the following command, replacing name-of-the-project with the name you want for your new project.


```bash
npx create-react-app name-of-the-project
```
This will create a new directory in your current location, with the name name-of-the-project.

Step 2: Navigate into the project directory

Change your current directory to the new project directory by running:

```bash
cd name-of-the-project
```

This will move your terminal location into the root directory of your new React project.
Step 3: Start the React App

Finally, you can start the React app by running:

```bash
npm start=
```
This command starts the development server and opens up your new React application in your default browser.
